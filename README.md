# TM1-MoS2
VASP output files of configurations of the TM1/MoS2 (TM1 = Co, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, and Au) structures (corresponding to structures in Fig. S1) and stationary points along the L-H mechanism with dissociative H2 adsorption (corresponding to structures in Fig. S6), L-H mechanism with molecular H2 adsorption (corresponding to structures in Fig. S7), and E-R mechanism (corresponding to structures in Fig. S8).
